The address has recently changed, prior to that it was 4062 Grumman Blvd, Calverton. 

JPE leases a small portion of a building that is located in part of the Calverton Executive Airpark/former Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant.

EPA-HQ-2013-005111,Request,Closed,James McCubbins,N/A,04/03/2013,N/A,"As a result of EPA's RFS2 regulations, companies that have processes that are not approved for biofuel pathway RIN generation under 40 CFR 80.1426 must petition EPA for pathway approval.  EPA provides a website that identifies pending petitions by companies, but does not provide the date that such petitions were received by EPA.  (see http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/renewablefuels/compliancehelp/rfs2-lca-pathways.htm)

Contractors working for EPA have claimed that the information requested (i.e. the date that EPA received the petition) is somehow confidential business information.

However, since the information reveals nothing about any proprietary technology, methods, processes, or information held by the company submitting the petition, and since all pending applications and approved applications are already posted on the website, I respectfully request information that associates the names of companies that have submitted petitions to EPA under 40 CFR 80.1416 with the dates those petitions were received by EPA.  In other words, a simple format could be, for example:

[Company Name]           [Date Petition Received]

For reasons due to E&ENews?s refusal to disclose public records CEI is not able to provide you the request date, number or search parameters. But we can inform EPA they were ?more than 1,000 pages of emails obtained by EnergyWire in a Freedom of Information Act request from EPA Region 6?. 
You can determine which production it was from this story (ENERGY WIRE (E&E News): Former Pa. Gov. Rendell pressed EPA in Range pollution case, emails show?, Mike Soraghan, E&E reporter, February 5, 2013 http://eenews.net/public/energywire/2013/02/05/1).
Although these records were provided to a requester whose fees were waived due to its status as a media entity -- a waiver created by law on the implicit grounds that such requesters would disseminate the information -- E&ENews has elected against posting the records. Despite inquiries, that requester has instead only posted a very small number among many responsive records.
Further, although EPA posts large document productions it releases to the undersigned Requester, EPA did not post or otherwise publish these responsive records despite determining they should be disseminated.
For these reasons, the information requested is still not available through means other than this request.
EPA has already searched for, identified, segregated and reviewed and produced these records. Production involves no more than providing Requester a link or an electronic copy of what the Agency recently provided another requester. It is impermissible to selectively release records among requesters.
This is a ?simple? request, requiring only that EPA duplicate a recently released document production. We therefore look forward to EPA?s production of electronic copies within the statutory period of time"

Part 2, relating to an egg-laying concentrated animal feeding operation in Hyde County, North

Earthjustice requests that EPA waive the fees it would otherwise charge for search and
production of the records described above. FOIA dictates that requested records be provided

Under the Freedom of Information Act, 1976 PA 442, as amended (FOIA), Environmental Consulting & Technology, Inc. (ECT) respectfully requests to review files for a site in The City of Douglas, Allegan County, Michigan 49406 that has been known by several names over the years but has no identifiable address. The tax identification/parcel numbers include 03-59-017-089-95, 03-59-017-089-00, 03-59-017-089-80, 03-59-017-089-70, 03-59-017-089-60, 03-59-017-089-30, 03-59-017-089-20, 03-59-017-089-00. The site has been commonly known as The Orchard Property, The Douglas Site located at Ferry and Center Streets, the proposed Beachside Village Property, Miro Property, Vistiana Property, and Wickstra/Taurus Exploration Property. The site should be identifiable by the district office as the site has been the focus of intense remediation related to a solvent plume (originating on the east adjoining property) as well as soil removal activities related to arsenic impact. To aid in identifying the property, I have attached an Allegan County Tax Assessors map that depicts the Subject Property via parcel ID numbers.

The east adjoining property, where the solvent plume originated, has been known as Chase Manufacturing and/or Hayworth Manufacturing. That is for reference only as at this time I am only interested in a file review for the Orchard property discussed above. 

Initially I am interested in identifying what files the EPA has on the property. More specifically, I am interested in delineating the solvent plume that has migrated onto the Subject Property and to see if the EPA has any information relating to soil removal. A list of reports and the copies of information related to plume delineation would be greatly appreciated. 

Please e-mail the files to me, if possible, at mgreenberg@ectinc.com .  If it is not possible to send the file electronically, please call me at (231)620-0317.  Thank you for your attention to this matter."

has registered Glutaraldehyde-based antimicrobial pesticides under registration numbers: 
88951-1 and 88951-2 , called Panax 500? 25 and Panax 500? 50, respectively.  Given that BASF Corporation is a listed Data Submitter for Glutaraldehyde (Company number 33753,Pesticide Data Submitters List, updated 9/25/13), Pan Asian Chemicals Inc. was required to offer BASF compensation provided its method of data support for any BASF owned studies relied upon by Pan Asian in support of its registration applications was either cite-all, selective, formulators exemption or via letter of data authorization.  To date, BASF has not received any such offer of compensation, either directly from Pan Asian or from one of BASF's direct customers. 
BASF therefore requests copies of Pan Asian Chemical's registration applications resulting in the two registrations listed above, specifically so that BASF can determine whether and how Pan Asian Chemical satisfied the data support requirements of EPA Form 8570-34 (and EPA Form 8570-35, if relevant), or otherwise satisfied the requirements stated at 40 CFR § 152 Subpart E (\"Procedures To Ensure Protection of Data Submitters?

I'm looking to obtain a detailed listing of ALL Federal Institutional Controls (ICs) and Engineering Controls (ECs) that are in place covering all the 10 EPA Regions.
To further explain, ICs are non-engineered instruments, such as administrative and legal controls, that help minimize the potential for human exposure to contamination and/or protect the integrity of the remedy. Although it is EPA's expectation that treatment or engineering controls will be used to address principal threat wastes and that groundwater will be returned to its beneficial use whenever practicable, ICs play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use and guide human behavior at a site. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent site land uses, like residential uses, that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
ECs encompass a variety of engineered and constructed physical barriers (e.g., soil capping, sub-surface venting systems, mitigation barriers, fences) to contain and/or prevent exposure to contamination on a property. 
Please note that my request is not site specific but rather I am interested in ALL Federal ICs and ECs data. This would include all ICs and ECs from the Superfund and RCRA programs, plus any other that exist.
Attached is an example of what was previously sent for this request. If you could please send the file in either text, Excel or Access format it would be highly appreciated. Thank you."

I would like to request the Pennsylvania portion of the FracFocus database assembled by the EPA as part of its study into hydraulic fracturing (http://www.epa.gov/hfstudy/)

In its Dec. 2012 progress report, the EPA stated that it had compiled into a database the FracFocus disclosure reports for wells fractured and entered into the system between January 1, 2011 and February 27, 2012. 

?Following the QA review, all data were organized into four data tables: locational data for each well disclosure, the original chemical-specific data for each well disclosure, the QA-reviewed chemical-specific data for each well disclosure, and records with water as ingredient. These four tables have been imported into a database and linked together using key fields, where they can be used for the analyses described below. The raw, pre-QA data values for well disclosures and chemical ingredients as they were exported from FracFocus have also been imported into the database for baseline reference data to prevent any loss of original operator data.? (http://www.epa.gov/hfstudy/pdfs/hf-report20121214.pdf)

According to the progress report, the database contains information for 1,050 wells in Pennsylvania. These are the records I?m requesting, if the additional work of breaking it out by state is not time or cost prohibitive. If you judge that separating Pennsylvania records from the whole would add more than a day or $25 to execute, I will gladly take the entire database containing all the states.

Please send the data by e-mail (alitvak@bizjournals.com) in a zipped file, or mail a CD or flash drive to 424 South 27th Street, Suite 211, Pittsburgh, PA 15203.

Dear FOIA director, Environmental Protection Agency:

Please send me any records since Jan. 1, 2014, held by the EPA, on the three Canadian to USA oil projects below, e.g., their possible impacts on American lands, waters, fish, wildlife; likelihood of spills, political lobbying for and against it; effects on global warming, etc.  Include any reports in that time, and correspondence between Canadian governmental or corporate officials and the EPA regarding these proposals.

[a] The proposed 1,177 kilometre Enbridge company pipeline, called ?Northern Gateway,? would carry 525,000 barrels per day of diluted bitumen oil from Alberta to a port in Kitimat in northern British Columbia, to be loaded onto tankers and shipped to Asia. (Many environ- mentalists oppose the project, fearing the tankers could spill oil with disastrous effects.)

[b] Kinder Morgan's proposed expansion of its existing TransMountain pipeline into the Port of Metro Vancouver, could increase tanker traffic by more than 1,000 trips annually off the Pacific coast.

[c] The proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta to Texas (which US President Obama is due to approve or not).  

Please exempt me from fees, for I am a low-budget journalist working in the educational and historical interest. Do not send press clippings or records already public.

In this regard, we note that none of the recipients has sent the REJV an offer to jointly develop or share the cost of developing the required data.  There are only three possible explanations for this: (1) the companies have committed to generate the required data on their own; (2) the companies have presented EPA with an explanation as to why they are exempt from the DCI (e.g., the formulator exemption applies to their registrations); or (3) the companies have informed EPA that they are cost sharing with the REJV but failed to tender such an offer to the REJV.  
The REJV would like to determine the facts before contacting the DCI recipients, and requested her assistance.  To that end, we sent Ms. Friedmand EPA?s list with an additional column.

EPA-HQ-2014-008904,Request,Closed,John Erickson,BASF Corporation,07/28/2014,N/A,"BASF Corporation (BASF) is seeking a copy of US EPA's PMN File for PMN P87-1764 (TSCA Pre-Manufacture Notice) it believes was filed by one of its predessor companies, Ciba-Geigy Corporation, Ciba Corporation or Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation.  The substance for which the PMN was filed is: 
CASRN 125643-61-0  Benzenepropanoic acid, 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy-, C7-9-branched alkyl esters, which the Ciba Plastic Additives Division sold for use as an antioxidant iin various plastics. 
When BASF acquired Ciba Corporation in 2010, that acquisition included the Ciba Plastic Additives business, which included certain products based on the referenced substance.   In 2008, Ciba submitted a TSCA 8(e) report to US EPA on the referenced substance, which is an action consistent with having filed the underlying PMN for that substance.   However, in the course of integrating Ciba into BASF during 2010-2012, Ciba was unable to locate a copy of the Ciba 1987 PMN application and related materials, which would now be useful toward management of change activities concerning this substance.  

If US EPA is able to confirm that PMN P87-1764 is now \"owned\" by BASF Corporation, BASF would then withdraw this FOIA request and submit the file request directly to US EPA  via a notarized letter on company letterhead, to the attention of Chandler Sirmons with a copy to Eric Brewer.

EPA-R9-2014-007473,Request,Closed,Eric Hopson,Basel Action Network,06/13/2014,N/A,"I am looking to attain copies of public records on Dlubak Glass, a recycling company located at 19472 S AVENUE 1 E, YUMA, AZ 85365, (FRS ID# 110039261303).

Specifically we are searching for documentation regarding recent soil cleanup efforts that Dlubak was required to undertaken as the result of 2009 inspections/violations.. and eventual 2014 consent judgements. Comprehensive records were received from Arizona Department of Environmental Quality in May 2014, and followup contacts were made, but they claim that they have no further information available and that what we seek may be with the EPA. 

We are trying to gather information on what areas were Dlubak required to cleanup, how were they supposed to clean it up, and did they ever accomplish it. 

It would be beneficial to simply receive \"all available public documents\" regarding Dlubak (as we were able to do with AZ DEQ), but I'm not sure if that is an option available from your agency. 

At the very least, if there are supporting correspondence regarding their violations or cleanup efforts we would appreciate copies of those. 

If there is any way I can help to reduce the burden of this request please let me know. 

Thank you for your time."

As I understand it, the EPA contracted with a testing laboratory based in Cincinnati, OH to assess the data compiled in the overflight operation.  In accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, I request copies of the following materials pertaining to these overflights and associated laboratory analyses: 

* All information and data the EPA provided the laboratory to analyze in connection with its assessment of mercury contamination in Clear Lake and on surrounding lands.
* All the information and write-ups the laboratory supplied to the EPA in connection with assessing mercury contamination in Clear Lake and on surrounding lands.
* All data procured in the course of overflight testing of mercury contamination in Clear Lake.
* All videos taken during said overflight testing.

Please cite the legal authorities on which you rely in making any decision not to disclose these records.

If the appropriateness for disclosure of some of the requested records cannot easily be determined while others can, please do send me those which are cleared for disclosure as soon as possible and withhold the others until their eligibility is determined.

I live in Kansas City and noticed a nice piece of property for sale in Platte County last week, drove up there, looked at it and then started to do my research as the property is for sale and as a foreclosure.  I believe you would be an excellent resource for me about this property, which is advertised for sale at 19105 Humphreys Rd., Platte City, Missouri BUT the address you may know from your EPA work is slightly different (19015), (perhaps the listing agent's way to skirt the obvious issues with the property).  I am suspect.

If you would be so kind to help me navigate the potential liability associated with this property and any action the EPA is still considering on the property, that would be very helpful.  

I care about the environment and found the property to be desirable mostly due to its elevation and the views from such a vantage point, but after reading through No. SC87691 in the Supreme Court of Missouri case Dennis E. Hess VS. Chase Manhattan Bank (attached), I wondered what light you may shed on the EPA's possible action to a new owner of the property and the associated costs for additional clean up.  Please provide an answer back to this question.

I also would like to know if the lake to the south of the property owned by Central Platte Holdings is contaminated.

EPA-HQ-2015-001711,Request,Assignment,Miranda E. Yaver,Columbia University,11/20/2014,12/22/2014,"I am conducting doctoral research on bureaucratic politics, with a substantive focus on environmental politics, from 1973 to the present. Given the political science literature's emphasis on lawmaking but relative inattention to policymaking processes in the aftermath of delegation, this study is looking at the complexities of policy implementation amid various types of separation of powers conflict, and provides important quantitative and theoretical contributions to our knowledge about the effects of litigation and partisan conflict in shaping the legal and policy outcomes we observe. 

Among other things, I am interested in the volume of litigation and threats of litigation against administrative agencies. I am requesting records of notices of intent to sue from 1973 forward (or as much of that time period as is available) since it is only available online from 2013 forward. If the documents themselves are unavailable going several years back, it would still be helpful to know the number of such notices of intent to sue per year, and with respect to which statute(s) implemented by the agency. I would also like a list of suits filed that were challenging final agency actions, for that same time period or as much of that time period as is available, and what the resolutions of those cases were (court vs. settlement, and ideally the dollar amount of the settlement/case resolution).

I have searched through your website and found a lot of up-to-date information (such as data from the ECHO database, or the SDWISFED database), but there are still information that I was not able to locate. If this is something that has been tracked by the EPA, I was hoping if you could help me. I understand that a lot of information requested might not be collected on the federal level and rather kept at hands of individual municipalities or recorded on state by state basis, but if you have any of the information above I would really appreciate you directing me towards the source. The information that I`m looking for is the following: Water treatment plants (WTPs) infrastructure overview (public and private; or any information available): - total municipal water supply capacity in the US (MGD) - total number of water connections in the US - total lengths of distribution network in the US - total amount of meter coverage in the US - total amount of non-revenue water generated in the US - material and diameter of water pipes Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) infrastructure overview: - volume of wastewater produced versus collected - number of sewerage connections - length of sewerage network - material and diameter of wastewater pipes Additionally, if you have carried out a survey that would provide an overview of water or wastewater tretametment capacity by technology used (i.e MBR, nutrient/ammonia removal technologies, UF/MF.. ) I would be very interested to have these results too. I`m also looking for the top 10 largest water treatment plants (WTPs) in the US. The above mentioned databases do not cover data by a WTPs and therefore I was wondering whether you could advice how best to get hold of this information. Thank you."

Also, we would a figure for the total export (i.e. fresh apples, dried apples, etc.).  The question we are trying to answer is the % of each crop that is exported and where it is exported to.

How long would it take to get the information?  What is the cost?

I further request subsequent EPA requests and Rain responses referenced in the attached letter dated June 10, 2013, stating: ?Thank you for your responses to the United States Environmental Protection Agency Region 6 (EPA) Section 114 Requests for Information as well as your response to subsequent requests submitted through email.?

	Concerned Citizens is a Louisiana neighborhood association working to restore the community in the Chalmette and Meraux neighborhoods surrounding the Valero Oil Refinery (formerly Murphy Oil Refinery) in Chalmette, Louisiana. Disclosure of the information sought by this request is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to Concerned Citizen?s and the general public?s understanding of the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency regarding air quality in their area and emissions from the Rain facility?especially in light of EPA?s recent nonattainment designation for the area regarding the sulfur dioxide 1-hour standard.

	Thank you for your assistance. Please feel free to contact me at (504) 865-5789 if you have any questions or require any clarification.

[2] The proposed $5-billion expansion of Kinder Morgan's TransMountain pipeline would triple its capacity to 890,000 barrels per day, as it carries Alberta oil sands diluted bitumen to Burnaby, to be then shipped in tankers (with a rise from four to 34 transits per month) through Vancouver harbour, the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Salish Sea.  The National Energy Board in Canada is now taking input, and will advise on if it should proceed, by July 2015.
