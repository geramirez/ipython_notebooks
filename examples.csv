214,EPA-HQ-2014-008041,"Hello,

I am a PhD student from Robert Gordon University, Scotland, and my research topic is estimating uncertainty in existing methodology in GHG emission for Iron and steel sector of USA.

Research Scope and Objective:
This research will study the existing methodology for estimating GHG emission of Iron and steel sector in USA. In the process, research will highlight the shortcomings and drawbacks in the methodology and finally come with alternative methodology.

It is observed that the existing methodology suggested by UNFCCC (production based) has many shortcomings as it do not cover the whole life cycle of the product. This aspect ignores majority of the emissions caused due to imports.  Alternative methodology is consumption based which accounts all emissions taking place within and outside the country and both upstream and down stream emission. 
More descriptions about the methodology and anomalies are described in the appendix (FOI-US) attached.

Questions:

1.      Are the organizations (EPA, Energy department and ministers) involved in GHGI aware about the serious short comings of the production or region based approach?
2.      If yes, then what steps organizations are taking to make a transition in methodology?
3.      Has USA highlighted this anomaly in methodology to UNFCC, IPCC and other governing bodies to incorporate more robust and modern methodology instead of using something outdated or something that gives false result.
4.       It is also observed that most of the GHG inventory data and especially Iron and steel sector is out sourced to Ricardo AEA. It is difficult to get actual calculation of emission estimation by Ricardo AEA. Is it possible to get hold of those calculations done by Ricardo AEA with the detail of input data used?"

We want to get a sense for how many enforcement actions are taking place, specifically under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) or Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) programs. It's our guess and hope that these numbers exist somewhere in your files as EPA likely has such figures in order to assess its own effectiveness. We would like to go back as far as 1998 as possible. I appreciate the likeliness that this would be a cumbersome exercise, but I'm hoping the information is readily available in an annual report somewhere. We are looking not only for EPA enforcement, but state-level enforcement as well if those numbers are available.

If such numbers are not available specifically for NSR/PSD enforcement actions, the total number of enforcement actions under the CAA by year dating back to 1998 would suffice.

My name is Brandon Heck and I am a 3rd year PhD student in economics at the University of California Santa Cruz. I am interested in working on a project (as my dissertation or part of) linking air quality action days to hospital visits in order to assess the existence and/or magnitude of positive health effects due to action days. 

I have access to hospital records (inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visits) for California, and may also be able to obtain data for other states as well, which will depend on the frequency of action days in those states as well as the fees associated with obtaining the records.

Given the above, my request is for a list of all national action days with their location and preferably the forecasted air quality index (and/or pollutant level), and the pollutant that caused the action day to be called. 

If it is of any assistance, I believe that Alison Sexton made a very similar request for work that she did on the effect of action days on time spent performing vigorous activities.

As far as timing, as much time as possible is preferable (as far back as is feasible and as most recent as is feasible).

4/17/2013- Revised per W. Calderon



Re: REVISED FOIA from 4/17/2013 (Open Public Records)

Dear Ms. Wanda Calderon;

Per your request, I have revised my request.  I am not an employee of EPA to know the names of the specific reports but according to your FOIA pages it states to give a reasonable description of what I am seeking according to Title 40 chapter 1 part 2 Subpart A paragraph C .

Can you please send to me the reports that already exist at the EPA office that can provide the following information?

1. REVISED:  Please provide report with a date that shows EPA finding of NOx and SO2 were at reasonable levels at Hovensa.

 2. REVISED:  Please provide report with a date that shows EPA findings of NOx and SO 2 were at  unreasonable levels or  at violation levels at Hovensa. 

3. REVISED:   Please provide a report that shows Hovensa has upheld the Consent Decree Agreement of 4.9 million and 700 million. Please provide the policy of EPA that shows EPA oversees all civil penalties to ensure that entity found in violation of the Clean Air Act adheres to fines.

4.  REVISED:  Please provide report that shows the effects of (NOx) and (SO2) at high levels or high emissions can or will cause on humans and the environment.   

Per FOIA I believe I am asking for current reports that should be readily available to the public, so the regular processing of 20 day is all that should be required and no extension would be needed. I do also believe that a waiver of fee is in order as well. I am not asking EPA to create any reports to accommodate my request. The information I seek should have already been created for the general public.

For reasons due to E&ENews?s refusal to disclose public records CEI is not able to provide you the request date, number or search parameters. But we can inform EPA they were ?more than 1,000 pages of emails obtained by EnergyWire in a Freedom of Information Act request from EPA Region 6?. 
You can determine which production it was from this story (ENERGY WIRE (E&E News): Former Pa. Gov. Rendell pressed EPA in Range pollution case, emails show?, Mike Soraghan, E&E reporter, February 5, 2013 http://eenews.net/public/energywire/2013/02/05/1).
Although these records were provided to a requester whose fees were waived due to its status as a media entity -- a waiver created by law on the implicit grounds that such requesters would disseminate the information -- E&ENews has elected against posting the records. Despite inquiries, that requester has instead only posted a very small number among many responsive records.
Further, although EPA posts large document productions it releases to the undersigned Requester, EPA did not post or otherwise publish these responsive records despite determining they should be disseminated.
For these reasons, the information requested is still not available through means other than this request.
EPA has already searched for, identified, segregated and reviewed and produced these records. Production involves no more than providing Requester a link or an electronic copy of what the Agency recently provided another requester. It is impermissible to selectively release records among requesters.
This is a ?simple? request, requiring only that EPA duplicate a recently released document production. We therefore look forward to EPA?s production of electronic copies within the statutory period of time"

In the event that this request results in research or copying, McClatchy Newspapers requests a public interest fee waiver because the material being sought is to be used in a news story. If a fee waiver is not granted, I agree to pay reasonable duplication costs. However, please notify me in advance if you anticipate those fees will exceed $50. I would prefer an electronic version of these reports. However, if one is not available or providing an electronic version would delay processing, I would accept the report on paper.  

If any part of this request is not granted, please provide legal justification in writing for each portion of information withheld, and cite the specific exemptions in FOIA law that allows that withholding.

We would argue strongly that there is a significant public interest in our reviewing the material being sought. As the nation?s third largest newspaper group with 30 dailies and a combined circulation of nearly 3 million, we feel we qualify as acting in the public interest.

The project area is also designated critical habitat for smelt.   

Prior to submitting the application for permit renewal to the Corps, we met with members of Corps, the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to establish criteria for pumping river water and performing work in the Cowlitz River.  It was agreed that our proposed pumping period was May 15 through October 31.  After we submitted our application, new information was apparently obtained by our NMFS ESA reviewer, Gayle Kreitman (360-753-9887, gayle.kreitman@noaa.gov), as she stated in her email dated August 12, so they will not allow in-water work or pumping until August 1.  Because in-water work windows are typically left to WDFW, we also contacted Steve West with WDFW (360-906-6720, steve.west@dfw.wa.gov), who stated in his email dated August 19 that the in-water work window is used for guidance only during permit preparation and that the permit would state the window for the permitted activities.  He indicated that July 16 through August 15 was the current in-water work window, that the July 16 date seemed reasonable, and that pumping ?prior to July 16 is ill-advised?.  

We request all public records, including published and unpublished studies and reports, that support limiting in-water work to certain times in the year in order to protect the Columbia River smelt or any other endangered or threatened species."

The site has been commonly known as The Orchard Property, The Douglas Site located at Ferry and Center Streets, the proposed Beachside Village Property, Miro Property, Vistiana Property, and Wickstra/Taurus Exploration Property. The site should be identifiable by the district office as the site has been the focus of intense remediation related to a solvent plume (originating on the east adjoining property) as well as soil removal activities related to arsenic impact. To aid in identifying the property, I have attached an Allegan County Tax Assessors map that depicts the Subject Property via parcel ID numbers.

The east adjoining property, where the solvent plume originated, has been known as Chase Manufacturing and/or Hayworth Manufacturing. That is for reference only as at this time I am only interested in a file review for the Orchard property discussed above. 

Initially I am interested in identifying what files the EPA has on the property. More specifically, I am interested in delineating the solvent plume that has migrated onto the Subject Property and to see if the EPA has any information relating to soil removal. A list of reports and the copies of information related to plume delineation would be greatly appreciated.

Given that BASF Corporation is a listed Data Submitter for Glutaraldehyde (Company number 33753,Pesticide Data Submitters List, updated 9/25/13), Pan Asian Chemicals Inc. was required to offer BASF compensation provided its method of data support for any BASF owned studies relied upon by Pan Asian in support of its registration applications was either cite-all, selective, formulators exemption or via letter of data authorization.  To date, BASF has not received any such offer of compensation, either directly from Pan Asian or from one of BASF's direct customers. 
BASF therefore requests copies of Pan Asian Chemical's registration applications resulting in the two registrations listed above, specifically so that BASF can determine whether and how Pan Asian Chemical satisfied the data support requirements of EPA Form 8570-34 (and EPA Form 8570-35, if relevant), or otherwise satisfied the requirements stated at 40 CFR § 152 Subpart E (\Procedures To Ensure Protection of Data Submitters?

843,EPA-HQ-2014-004569,"Hello,
I'm looking to obtain a detailed listing of ALL Federal Institutional Controls (ICs) and Engineering Controls (ECs) that are in place covering all the 10 EPA Regions.
To further explain, ICs are non-engineered instruments, such as administrative and legal controls, that help minimize the potential for human exposure to contamination and/or protect the integrity of the remedy. Although it is EPA's expectation that treatment or engineering controls will be used to address principal threat wastes and that groundwater will be returned to its beneficial use whenever practicable, ICs play an important role in site remedies because they reduce exposure to contamination by limiting land or resource use and guide human behavior at a site. For instance, zoning restrictions prevent site land uses, like residential uses, that are not consistent with the level of cleanup.
ECs encompass a variety of engineered and constructed physical barriers (e.g., soil capping, sub-surface venting systems, mitigation barriers, fences) to contain and/or prevent exposure to contamination on a property. 
Please note that my request is not site specific but rather I am interested in ALL Federal ICs and ECs data. This would include all ICs and ECs from the Superfund and RCRA programs, plus any other that exist.
Attached is an example of what was previously sent for this request. If you could please send the file in either text, Excel or Access format it would be highly appreciated. Thank you."

I would like to request the Pennsylvania portion of the FracFocus database assembled by the EPA as part of its study into hydraulic fracturing (http://www.epa.gov/hfstudy/)

In its Dec. 2012 progress report, the EPA stated that it had compiled into a database the FracFocus disclosure reports for wells fractured and entered into the system between January 1, 2011 and February 27, 2012. 

?Following the QA review, all data were organized into four data tables: locational data for each well disclosure, the original chemical-specific data for each well disclosure, the QA-reviewed chemical-specific data for each well disclosure, and records with water as ingredient. These four tables have been imported into a database and linked together using key fields, where they can be used for the analyses described below. The raw, pre-QA data values for well disclosures and chemical ingredients as they were exported from FracFocus have also been imported into the database for baseline reference data to prevent any loss of original operator data.? (http://www.epa.gov/hfstudy/pdfs/hf-report20121214.pdf)

According to the progress report, the database contains information for 1,050 wells in Pennsylvania. These are the records I?m requesting, if the additional work of breaking it out by state is not time or cost prohibitive. If you judge that separating Pennsylvania records from the whole would add more than a day or $25 to execute, I will gladly take the entire database containing all the states.

Please send the data by e-mail (alitvak@bizjournals.com) in a zipped file, or mail a CD or flash drive to 424 South 27th Street, Suite 211, Pittsburgh, PA 15203.

We seek clarification from EPA as to how each DCI recipient intends to satisfy the DCI.  In this regard, we note that none of the recipients has sent the REJV an offer to jointly develop or share the cost of developing the required data.  There are only three possible explanations for this: (1) the companies have committed to generate the required data on their own; (2) the companies have presented EPA with an explanation as to why they are exempt from the DCI (e.g., the formulator exemption applies to their registrations); or (3) the companies have informed EPA that they are cost sharing with the REJV but failed to tender such an offer to the REJV.  
The REJV would like to determine the facts before contacting the DCI recipients, and requested her assistance.  To that end, we sent Ms. Friedmand EPA?s list with an additional column.  In the new third column, we identified those DCI recipients that are members of the REJV, and asked that she indicate for the remaining parties whether they have committed to generating the data on their own or represented that they have made a cost-sharing offer to the REJV."

I live in Kansas City and noticed a nice piece of property for sale in Platte County last week, drove up there, looked at it and then started to do my research as the property is for sale and as a foreclosure.  I believe you would be an excellent resource for me about this property, which is advertised for sale at 19105 Humphreys Rd., Platte City, Missouri BUT the address you may know from your EPA work is slightly different (19015), (perhaps the listing agent's way to skirt the obvious issues with the property).  I am suspect.

If you would be so kind to help me navigate the potential liability associated with this property and any action the EPA is still considering on the property, that would be very helpful.  

I care about the environment and found the property to be desirable mostly due to its elevation and the views from such a vantage point, but after reading through No. SC87691 in the Supreme Court of Missouri case Dennis E. Hess VS. Chase Manhattan Bank (attached), I wondered what light you may shed on the EPA's possible action to a new owner of the property and the associated costs for additional clean up.  Please provide an answer back to this question.

I also would like to know if the lake to the south of the property owned by Central Platte Holdings is contaminated.

There is an urgent nature to this request as I'd like to make an informed buying decision about the property.

1958,EPA-HQ-2015-001711,"I am conducting doctoral research on bureaucratic politics, with a substantive focus on environmental politics, from 1973 to the present. Given the political science literature's emphasis on lawmaking but relative inattention to policymaking processes in the aftermath of delegation, this study is looking at the complexities of policy implementation amid various types of separation of powers conflict, and provides important quantitative and theoretical contributions to our knowledge about the effects of litigation and partisan conflict in shaping the legal and policy outcomes we observe. 

Among other things, I am interested in the volume of litigation and threats of litigation against administrative agencies. I am requesting records of notices of intent to sue from 1973 forward (or as much of that time period as is available) since it is only available online from 2013 forward. If the documents themselves are unavailable going several years back, it would still be helpful to know the number of such notices of intent to sue per year, and with respect to which statute(s) implemented by the agency. I would also like a list of suits filed that were challenging final agency actions, for that same time period or as much of that time period as is available, and what the resolutions of those cases were (court vs. settlement, and ideally the dollar amount of the settlement/case resolution).
