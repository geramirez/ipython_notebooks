At this time, and from the perspective of the Public Affairs Division's, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) program, use of the government lotus notes system for Union related issues creates a strain in the records management process as communications back and forth, albeit, Union related correspondence, is not considered conducting Agency business.  We must be very careful what we put in writing as it could be part of a FOIA request and/or a Congressional initiated FOIA audit (as evidenced by history).

EPA-HQ-2014-008041,Request,Closed,Amar A. Nayak,Robert Gordon University,07/02/2014,N/A,"Hello,

I am a PhD student from Robert Gordon University, Scotland, and my research topic is estimating uncertainty in existing methodology in GHG emission for Iron and steel sector of USA.

Research Scope and Objective:
This research will study the existing methodology for estimating GHG emission of Iron and steel sector in USA. In the process, research will highlight the shortcomings and drawbacks in the methodology and finally come with alternative methodology.

It is observed that the existing methodology suggested by UNFCCC (production based) has many shortcomings as it do not cover the whole life cycle of the product. This aspect ignores majority of the emissions caused due to imports.  Alternative methodology is consumption based which accounts all emissions taking place within and outside the country and both upstream and down stream emission. 
More descriptions about the methodology and anomalies are described in the appendix (FOI-US) attached.

Questions:

1.      Are the organizations (EPA, Energy department and ministers) involved in GHGI aware about the serious short comings of the production or region based approach?
2.      If yes, then what steps organizations are taking to make a transition in methodology?
3.      Has USA highlighted this anomaly in methodology to UNFCC, IPCC and other governing bodies to incorporate more robust and modern methodology instead of using something outdated or something that gives false result.
4.       It is also observed that most of the GHG inventory data and especially Iron and steel sector is out sourced to Ricardo AEA. It is difficult to get actual calculation of emission estimation by Ricardo AEA. Is it possible to get hold of those calculations done by Ricardo AEA with the detail of input data used?"

I would like a copy of the Premium Class Travel reports that your agency is required to file with the General Services Administration for FY 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and if available at time of processing FY 2014. This report documents premium travel by your agency employees. Agencies must submit data or a negative report to GSA annually. If your agency submitted a negative report, I would like a copy of it. If your agency is exempt, your agency is required submit aggregate information. If your agency was exempt and submitted aggregate information, I would like a copy of the aggregate information.  

In the event that this request results in research or copying, McClatchy Newspapers requests a public interest fee waiver because the material being sought is to be used in a news story. If a fee waiver is not granted, I agree to pay reasonable duplication costs. However, please notify me in advance if you anticipate those fees will exceed $50. I would prefer an electronic version of these reports. However, if one is not available or providing an electronic version would delay processing, I would accept the report on paper.  

If any part of this request is not granted, please provide legal justification in writing for each portion of information withheld, and cite the specific exemptions in FOIA law that allows that withholding.

We would argue strongly that there is a significant public interest in our reviewing the material being sought. As the nation?s third largest newspaper group with 30 dailies and a combined circulation of nearly 3 million, we feel we qualify as acting in the public interest. The cost of travel by government officials is obviously of interest to the American public. As a result, I would like my FOIA to be processed in an expedited manner.

(Brevoortia patronus) Fishery 

Dear Sir/Madam: 

On behalf of the Recirculating Farms Coalition, I am writing to request the opportunity to inspect and copy any public records related to the gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) fishery from the period of January 2000 to the present. 
For the purposes of this request \"records\" includes any and all correspondence, letters, reports, documents, memoranda, summaries and notes of meetings and conversations, emails, and email attachments. I am also interested in inspecting any scientific and/or economic data, studies and/or assessments related to the gulf menhaden from January 2000-present. Such information may include, but should not be limited to, any information related to bycatch from the gulf menhaden fishery, gulf menhaden mortality and lifecycle studies, studies of various predators (ie Brown Pelicans) that feed on menhaden. 
Also, I am requesting the opportunity to inspect any documents and/or studies that the Department of Commerce or any of its subordinate agencies may have that discuss menhaden in relation to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. These documents may exist in various workplans and injury assessments conducted as a part of National Resource Damage Assessments. Menhaden may not be the focus of any particular document, but could be mentioned in various studies because of its important ecological role in the Gulf of Mexico. For instance, the brown pelican and bottlenose dolphin feed on menhaden, and menhaden may be mentioned in various documents that focus on these predator species. 

Should you have any questions pertaining to this request, please do not hesitate to contact me. Please respond to this request within five working days of its receipt.

EPA-HQ-2013-010354,Request,Closed,Brandon W. Heck,University of California Santa Cruz,09/26/2013,N/A,"Hello,

My name is Brandon Heck and I am a 3rd year PhD student in economics at the University of California Santa Cruz. I am interested in working on a project (as my dissertation or part of) linking air quality action days to hospital visits in order to assess the existence and/or magnitude of positive health effects due to action days. 

I have access to hospital records (inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visits) for California, and may also be able to obtain data for other states as well, which will depend on the frequency of action days in those states as well as the fees associated with obtaining the records.

Given the above, my request is for a list of all national action days with their location and preferably the forecasted air quality index (and/or pollutant level), and the pollutant that caused the action day to be called. 

If it is of any assistance, I believe that Alison Sexton made a very similar request for work that she did on the effect of action days on time spent performing vigorous activities.

As far as timing, as much time as possible is preferable (as far back as is feasible and as most recent as is feasible).

Thank you very much for your time and please let me know if you have any questions on my request."

EPA-HQ-2015-002630,Request,Assignment,Benjamin Geman,National Journal,12/23/2014,01/23/2015,"This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.

I request that a copy of the following documents, or documents containing the following information, be provided to me: All communication (including but not limited to letters, emails, meeting requests, and meeting records) between the Environmental Protection Agency and outside parties (including other federal agencies, the White House, environmental groups and others) concerning: EPA's review and comments on the State Department's Environmental Impact Statement on the Keystone XL pipeline. I'm also seeking internal EPA communication that led to EPA's conclusion that the GHG analysis in the draft EIS was insufficient. 

This request covers documents related to EPA's April 22, 2013 comments on State's draft EIS, which are found here: http://www.epa.gov/compliance/nepa/keystone-xl-project-epa-comment-letter-20130056.pdf

It also covers EPA's preparation to submit comments on State's January, 2014 final EIS. The comments have not yet been submitted due to the ongoing Nebraska Supreme Court case over the state's pipeline siting law.

In order to help to determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am a representative of the news media affiliated with National Journal.

This request is made as part of news gathering and not for a commercial use.

I request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest.

Re: REVISED FOIA from 4/17/2013 (Open Public Records)

Dear Ms. Wanda Calderon;

Per your request, I have revised my request.  I am not an employee of EPA to know the names of the specific reports but according to your FOIA pages it states to give a reasonable description of what I am seeking according to Title 40 chapter 1 part 2 Subpart A paragraph C .
.  

Can you please send to me the reports that already exist at the EPA office that can provide the following information?

1. REVISED:  Please provide report with a date that shows EPA finding of NOx and SO2 were at reasonable levels at Hovensa.

 2. REVISED:  Please provide report with a date that shows EPA findings of NOx and SO 2 were at  unreasonable levels or  at violation levels at Hovensa. 

3. REVISED:   Please provide a report that shows Hovensa has upheld the Consent Decree Agreement of 4.9 million and 700 million. Please provide the policy of EPA that shows EPA oversees all civil penalties to ensure that entity found in violation of the Clean Air Act adheres to fines.

4.  REVISED:  Please provide report that shows the effects of (NOx) and (SO2) at high levels or high emissions can or will cause on humans and the environment.   

Per FOIA I believe I am asking for current reports that should be readily available to the public, so the regular processing of 20 day is all that should be required and no extension would be needed. I do also believe that a waiver of fee is in order as well. I am not asking EPA to create any reports to accommodate my request. The information I seek should have already been created for the general public. 

Please send this information via this email address or any correspondence. You received my FOIA request via this avenue; I would like to also receive it this way as well. You can create your letters to me 
but I request that you scan them thereafter so that it can be a"

For reasons due to E&ENews?s refusal to disclose public records CEI is not able to provide you the request date, number or search parameters. But we can inform EPA they were ?more than 1,000 pages of emails obtained by EnergyWire in a Freedom of Information Act request from EPA Region 6?. 
You can determine which production it was from this story (ENERGY WIRE (E&E News): Former Pa. Gov. Rendell pressed EPA in Range pollution case, emails show?, Mike Soraghan, E&E reporter, February 5, 2013 http://eenews.net/public/energywire/2013/02/05/1).
Although these records were provided to a requester whose fees were waived due to its status as a media entity -- a waiver created by law on the implicit grounds that such requesters would disseminate the information -- E&ENews has elected against posting the records. Despite inquiries, that requester has instead only posted a very small number among many responsive records.
Further, although EPA posts large document productions it releases to the undersigned Requester, EPA did not post or otherwise publish these responsive records despite determining they should be disseminated.
For these reasons, the information requested is still not available through means other than this request.
EPA has already searched for, identified, segregated and reviewed and produced these records. Production involves no more than providing Requester a link or an electronic copy of what the Agency recently provided another requester. It is impermissible to selectively release records among requesters.
This is a ?simple? request, requiring only that EPA duplicate a recently released document production. We therefore look forward to EPA?s production of electronic copies within the statutory period of time"

Section 26 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (\"FIFRA\")  states, in part: 

\"(a) In general
For the purposes of this subchapter, a State shall have primary enforcement responsibility for pesticide use violations during any period for which the Administrator determines that such State?
(1) has adopted adequate pesticide use laws and regulations, except that the Administrator may not require a State to have pesticide use laws that are more stringent than this subchapter; 
(2) has adopted and is implementing adequate procedures for the enforcement of such State laws and regulations; and 
(3) will keep such records and make such reports showing compliance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection as the Administrator may require by regulation.\" 

This delegation has been codified at 7 USC 136w-1(a).  The Government Accountability Project requests that the Environmental Protection Agency furnish each document, record, draft, and release that indicates the EPA's official determination a state has adopted adequate laws and procedures pursuant to 7 USC 136w-1(a).  GAP requests such documents and releases applicable to every state that the EPA granted enforcement responsibility.   By honoring this request, the EPA will promote greater protection for pesticide workers.  This can be concluded with certainty because if workers were aware of how effectively state authorities ensure they are not retaliated against for reporting safety violations, those workers will be more likely to report those violations.  In turn, employers are less likely to violate their safety obligations in the first instance."

This report documents premium travel by your agency employees. Agencies must submit data or a negative report to GSA annually. If your agency submitted a negative report, I would like a copy of it. If your agency is exempt, your agency is required submit aggregate information. If your agency was exempt and submitted aggregate information, I would like a copy of the aggregate information.  

In the event that this request results in research or copying, McClatchy Newspapers requests a public interest fee waiver because the material being sought is to be used in a news story. If a fee waiver is not granted, I agree to pay reasonable duplication costs. However, please notify me in advance if you anticipate those fees will exceed $50. I would prefer an electronic version of these reports. However, if one is not available or providing an electronic version would delay processing, I would accept the report on paper.  

If any part of this request is not granted, please provide legal justification in writing for each portion of information withheld, and cite the specific exemptions in FOIA law that allows that withholding.

We would argue strongly that there is a significant public interest in our reviewing the material being sought. As the nation?s third largest newspaper group with 30 dailies and a combined circulation of nearly 3 million, we feel we qualify as acting in the public interest. The cost of travel by government officials is obviously of interest to the American public. As a result, I would like my FOIA to be processed in an expedited manner.

The project area is also designated critical habitat for smelt.   

Prior to submitting the application for permit renewal to the Corps, we met with members of Corps, the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to establish criteria for pumping river water and performing work in the Cowlitz River.  It was agreed that our proposed pumping period was May 15 through October 31.  After we submitted our application, new information was apparently obtained by our NMFS ESA reviewer, Gayle Kreitman (360-753-9887, gayle.kreitman@noaa.gov), as she stated in her email dated August 12, so they will not allow in-water work or pumping until August 1.  Because in-water work windows are typically left to WDFW, we also contacted Steve West with WDFW (360-906-6720, steve.west@dfw.wa.gov), who stated in his email dated August 19 that the in-water work window is used for guidance only during permit preparation and that the permit would state the window for the permitted activities.  He indicated that July 16 through August 15 was the current in-water work window, that the July 16 date seemed reasonable, and that pumping ?prior to July 16 is ill-advised?.  

We request all public records, including published and unpublished studies and reports, that support limiting in-water work to certain times in the year in order to protect the Columbia River smelt or any other endangered or threatened species."

Mailing Address: 28 Goldsmith Street, Unit 2, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130
Phone: (802) 535-2335

I am writing to request access to the following documents in the following EPA Docket:
-EPA Docket #: RCRA-I-94--1071 \"In the Matter of The Commonwealth of Mass, MHD\"

DOCUMENTS:
- ?MHD complaint?
- ?MHD SEP 1/3/95?
- ?MHD SEP 5/1/95?
- ?MHD Dudley Street Proposal?
- ?MHD Neponset River Proposal?

Background:
My name is Jesse Seamon, and I am a graduate student in Urban Planning researching the Supplemental Environmental Project history of a site that is now a community greenhouse in Roxbury (at 11 Brook Ave, Roxbury 02119). The SEP project I am interested in originated on April 1, 1993, when EPA Region1 first learned about pollution at Mass. Highway Department facilities.  Several subsequent investigations confirmed many MHD facilities to be polluted.  Litigation followed under CERCLA/RCRA, and a settlement was reached in about a year, which included $20 million for cleanup costs and $5 million for SEPs. At the time this was the largest settlement with a state agency under RCRA. The MHD Dudley Street Proposal is what resulted in the cleanup of a polluted former garage at 11 Brook Ave in Roxbury, and redevelopment into the greenhouse that is there today.

These documents are instrumental to my Master?s thesis, and I would greatly appreciate access to them as soon as possible. 

I have been in contact with Lisa Papetti at EPA Region 1 (papetti.lisa@epa.gov), and she was kind enough to dig up the Consent Order and Agreement document that is in the above docket (which is why I did not include it in my document list above.  However, she could not find these other documents, which is why I am submitting this request. 

Lastly, I have attached the Consent Order document that Lisa found for me, in case that will help you locate the documents I have requested.  Thank you so much.

Best,
Jesse Seamon"

I need the email records between Mark J Huff, David R Baker, and Lee Hofmann.  There was bias there that could lead to me being fired.  

On Sept 8, 2009 the OIG did an investigation of OSWER/ORCR and their handling of Coal Ash.  I testified honestly during this investigation that OSWER/ORCR ignored data that proved to coal ash was harmful to human health and the environment.  This investigation disclosed that data that showed that coal ash was harmful to human health and the environment was ignored by high level OSWER/ORCR managers.  A special was done on 60 minutes where they called Lisa Jackson out on this and she had to apologize to the American public.   It made several OSWER/ORCR managers look very bad.  Staff were reassigned, the OSWER/ORCR C2P2 program was cancelled and many high level managers got in big trouble.  PEER later posted my comments that made OSWER/ORCR managers look bad on the internet.   Do a google search now with the key words \"Mike Clipper EPA coal ash\" and you will instantly see why I am filing this complaint.  

You will find this:

http://www.peer.org/assets/docs/epa/7_18_11_EPA_sci_suppression.pdf

I was on a detail in 2010 and 2011 as a Team Leader and I received an \"Exceeds Expectations\" PARS Rating.  I returned to work for Lee Hofmann in OSWER/ERAS in late 2011 and she told me that I couldn't write a document or do spreadsheet work in EXCEL things that I had been doing for 20 years.  Lee would mislead me behind closed doors and tell me that I was a poorly performing employee.  Mark Huff Lee's supervisor would just deny these things were happening and he would defend Lee.  Lee and Mark then just attacked me and tried to have me fired.  Now I am about to be FIRED in mid-January 2015 because I didn't pass heavily biased performance plan."
